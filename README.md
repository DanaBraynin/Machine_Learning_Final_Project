# Machine Learning Final Project
**Is a file malicious?**<br>
**By: Dana Braynin and Raz Graider**<br><br>
This project was done as a final project as part of a Machine Learning course at Tel Aviv University.<br><br>
We were given information about several features of executable files (.exe) and were asked to build a model that predicts the chance of a particular file to be malicious through static analysis of the files.<br>
This project is a binary classification problem in which we classified files into two categories - is the file malicious (1) or not (0), based on the features in the data set. Some of the features we received are known and some are anonymous.<br>
We received 60,000 observations that were classified as a malicious/non-malicious file. We analyzed the given data, processed it and selected the best model to predict the patterns in the unseen test data.<br><br>
We achieved a test AUC score of 0.9579 using "XGBoost classifier".<br>
We recieved a score of 95 on this project.<br><br>
The project is in Jupyter Notebook in Python and Markdown.<br><br>
